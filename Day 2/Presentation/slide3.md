# Taking input from the user
- **input** : Reads a number from user input.
  - You can assign (store) the result of input into a variable.

  	print "Your age is", age
  	print "You have", 65 - age, "years until retirement"
  ```
  	**Output**:

  	How old are you? 53
  	Your age is 53
  	You have 12 years until retirement
  ```
