#Expressions / Mathematical Operations
- Expression: A data value or set of operations to compute a value.
	- Examples:	1 + 4*3 = 13
                
- Arithmetic operators we will use:
    - \+ - * /		addition, subtraction/negation, multiplication, division
    - % 			modulus, a.k.a. remainder
    - **	 		exponentiation

- Precedence: Order in which operations are computed.
    - \* \/ % ** have a higher precedence than + -1 + 3 * 4 is 13

- Parentheses can be used to force a certain order of evaluation.(1 + 3) * 4 is 16
