# Expressions / Mathematical Operations
- Expression: A data value or set of operations to compute a value.
	- Examples:	1 + 4*3 = 13    
	<P/>
- Arithmetic operators we will use:
    - \+ - * /		addition, subtraction/negation, multiplication, division
    - % 			modulus, a.k.a. remainder
    - **	 		exponentiation
 	<P/>
- Precedence: Order in which operations are computed.
    - \* \/ % * have a higher precedence than + eg: 1+3*4 is 13
    <P/>
- Parentheses can be used to force a certain order of evaluation. (1 + 3) * 4 is 16
