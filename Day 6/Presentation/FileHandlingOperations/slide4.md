# Example
```
#open file in read mode
f = open("test.txt")
#The code above is the same as:
f = open("test.txt","r")
```

```
#open file in read mode
f = open("test.txt","w")
```

```
#open file in append mode
f = open("test.txt","a")
#This will add new data to the previous data in the text.txt file

```
