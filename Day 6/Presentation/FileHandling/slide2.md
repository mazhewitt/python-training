# Syntax
- To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file:
    ```
    f = open("demofile.txt")
    ```
- The code above is the same as:
    ```
    f = open("demofile.txt", "rt")
    ```
- Because "r" for read, and "t" for text are the default values, you do not need to specify them.
