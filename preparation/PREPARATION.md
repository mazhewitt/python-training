**Preparation for CodeRed Python Course**
For the course we will use an online IDE named repl.it. It is a simple but powerful development environment and well suited to get started with programming. You can setup a project instantly and it supports a wide range of programming languages.

**Get started**
The only thing you have to is to open https://repl.it in your favorite browser. If you would like to keep your projects for later reference or to continue coding after the course it is recommended to create an account.

The editor will open and you can start coding.
Type `print("hello world")` into the editor and hit the run button you should see **hello world** printed out on the right side in the output panel.
