### Excercise 2 ###
# 2. Let's plan some shopping. We want to get some fruits, vegies and diary products:
fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lemon', 'Orange']
vegies = ['Carrot', 'Pumpkin']
diary = ['Milk', 'Cheese', 'Butter']

# 2.1 Check how many product from each category we want to buy

# 2.2 Create one shopping list called basket with all the products

# 2.3 We forgot about cucumber - can you add it to the list of vegies?

# 2.4 Let's check what is in our basket now:
print(basket)
# Is cucumber in the basket? Can you explain why?

# We create one more list called sweets:
sweets = ['Chocolate', 'Biscuits']

# 2.5 Try to add sweets to the basket using append() and extend() methods. Do you see the difference?
