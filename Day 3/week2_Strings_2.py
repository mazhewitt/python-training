### Excercise 2 ###
# 2 Let's try to do some changes with a string 'LETTER'

word = 'LETTER'

# Try to change the first character to 'B' by assignment

word['fill the index'] = 'B'

# Did it work? If not - how to fix it?

# Now, try to do the same with replace() function.

# And check what is the value of word. Has it been updated? If not - why and how to fix it?
