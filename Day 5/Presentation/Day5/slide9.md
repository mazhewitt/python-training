- The **range()** function can be used with up to 3 arguments separated by the coma. 
```
for rooms_to_hoover in range(2, 4, 2):
    print(rooms_to_hoover)
```
- What will be printed out?
- If **range(y)** is used with one argument, it will start with 0 up to the value of the **y** argument not including it, with default increment 1.
- If **range(x, y)** is used with 2 arguments, it will start with the value of first argument(x) up to the value of the second argument(y) not including it, with default increment 1.
- If **range(x, y, z)** is used with 3 arguments, it will start with the value of first argument(x) up to the value of the second argument(y) not including it, with the increment set to third argument(z).
